Project Description:
In this project, I set out to examine song popularity in the streaming age of music with my principal research question: what key factors might differentiate songs as more “streamable” than others? In order to examine key factors, I further broke my research down into the following sub-question sets:
1. What is the relationship between key attributes and song genre? What is the relationship between key attributes and song era?
2. What is the relationship between key attributes and song popularity?
3. What is the relationship between song genre and song popularity? What is the relationship between song era and song popularity?
- Follow up: To what extent does a stream cap exist based on genre? Based on era?
